      <h3>How to Make Fruit Leather</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash, peel and remove any stems or pits, if needed. The skin of the fruit is highly nutritious so we always use the peel as well (exception: bananas, pineapples, oranges, etc).</li>
                <li>Put all the produce into a blender or food processor, with your sweetener of choice, and blend until smooth.
                    * If making the Strawberry Rhubarb variation: The rhubarb needs to be softened so after dicing put into a pot with just enough water to cover them and cook on medium until soft, we pour everything from the pot, water and all, into the processor so we don’t lose the nutrients</li>
                <li>Optional Step: We have found if your preheat the mixture in a pot before putting it in the dehydrator it speeds up the drying time. Just dump the blended mixture into a pot and heat on medium for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally</li>
                <li>Line trays with parchment paper. Spread onto dehydrated trays. Since the sides dry quicker, make the puree thicker around the edges - approx 1/4” inch and 1/8” at the center.</li>
                <li>Dry at 145F/63C for 6-8 hours. Another way to speed up drying time is to check after a few hours and remove the wrap/paper. When the leathers are dried, they will be a little bit shiny and non-sticky to the touch. Allow them to cool before removing them from the trays.</li>
                <li>Roll the leather into a tight roll and with a sharp knife, cut into a lengths of your choice. Wrap pieces with saran wrap, put in air-tight containers (like ziplock bags) or vacuum seal. Store in a cool, dark & dry place.</li>
            </ol>
